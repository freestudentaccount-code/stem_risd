Prompt:
Please create a barebones index.html file with no information.

Reasoning:
Provide an empty placeholder `index.html` at the repository root for simple hosting/demo scenarios. The file intentionally contains no visible information in the body.

Changed:
- Added `index.html` (barebones HTML with empty body).

Modified Files:
- index.html
- CHANGE.md

GitHub Commit Summary:
- Add barebones index.html placeholder
