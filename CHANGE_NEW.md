Prompt:
* Please randomize the aliens so they aren't all the same on the row.
* This game play is SUPER slow. Speed it up.
* Add a synth sound generator for effects
* The lines are a little bit blurry when the spaceship travels left and right. Can you do less trailing behind them?

Reasoning:
Improve game experience by randomizing alien placement for visual variety, significantly increasing game speed for better responsiveness, adding procedural audio effects using Web Audio API synth sounds, and reducing the blurry trailing effect to make movement appear crisp. These changes make the game more engaging and visually clear.

Changed:
- Modified `createAlienWave()` to randomize alien types within rows with bias toward harder aliens in higher rows
- Increased all game speeds: player speed (5â†’8), alien speeds (0.3-0.7 â†’ 0.8-1.6), bullet speeds (8â†’12 player, -4â†’-6 alien)
- Reduced alien shooting timers for more frequent action
- Added Web Audio API synth sound generator with 4 sound types: shoot, explosion, alienHit, powerup
- Implemented procedural sound effects using oscillators with different waveforms and frequency sweeps
- Added audio context initialization on first user interaction to comply with browser policies
- Reduced canvas clearing opacity from 0.1 to 0.3 to minimize blurry trailing effects during movement

Modified Files:
- game.js
- CHANGE.md

GitHub Commit Summary:
- Randomize alien placement, speed up gameplay, add synth sound effects, fix blurry movement trails

Prompt:
Let's go ahead and create an emoji Space evaders game that is similar to Space Invaders with ships, aliens with different layers and a timer showing high scores. Ahead of this we will make this a very fun and interactive game that people are able to register their names for their highest scores. We want to go ahead and have it have visual effects, explosions, glowing effects, a star field in the background, make it use the full keyboard control left and right arrow keys. And the spacebar to shoot.

Reasoning:
Create a comprehensive, interactive Space Invaders-style game using emojis for visual elements. The game includes full keyboard controls, multiple alien types, visual effects, high score tracking with name registration, and progressive difficulty levels. This provides an engaging, educational demonstration of HTML5 Canvas game development with modern web technologies.

Changed:
- Completely rebuilt `index.html` with game structure including canvas, UI panels, score display, game over screen, and high scores leaderboard
- Created `game.css` with animated starfield background, glowing effects, explosion animations, particle effects, and responsive design
- Created `game.js` with full game engine including player controls, multiple alien types (ðŸ‘¾ðŸ›¸ðŸ‘½ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¹), collision detection, explosion effects, particle systems, level progression, score tracking, timer, and persistent high scores with localStorage
- Game features: ðŸš€ player ship with arrow key movement and spacebar shooting, 5 different alien types with varying points and speeds, animated starfield background, explosion and particle effects, progressive difficulty, lives system, timer, and top 10 high scores with name registration

Modified Files:
- index.html
- game.css (new)
- game.js (new)
- CHANGE.md

GitHub Commit Summary:
- Create complete emoji Space Evaders game with visual effects, high scores, and progressive gameplay

Prompt:
Please create a barebones index.html file with no information.

Reasoning:
Provide an empty placeholder `index.html` at the repository root for simple hosting/demo scenarios. The file intentionally contains no visible information in the body.

Changed:
- Added `index.html` (barebones HTML with empty body).

Modified Files:
- index.html
- CHANGE.md

GitHub Commit Summary:
- Add barebones index.html placeholder
